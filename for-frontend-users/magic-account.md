# MaGIC Account

### Single Sign On

MaGIC Central is connected with MaGIC Account ([https://account.mymagic.my](https://account.mymagic.my), aka MaGIC Connect) for its single-sign-on feature, allowing multiple applications developed within our ecosystem to connect with one single user account.&#x20;

As new user, you may choose either **one-click social media instant login **(recommended, no sign-up required); or sign-up and login through traditional method.

Accounts are tied to a unique email address and requires verification to access the system.

### Social Media Instant Login

This is the recommended way to gain access into the system. No sign-up stage is required as your social media provider is a trusted source of identification.
