### Update Organisation

{% hint style="info" %}
Don't be surprise if you are unable to locate the update button and modify organisation thru Member Control Panel. Your access to modify may be removed by admin for various reasons:

* You are creating multiple duplicate profiles of the same company
* We had improved your organisation's detail and like it to be lock temporary, free from unexpected update.
{% endhint %}

Your organisation profile is reusable for other services on MaGIC Central. For example, startup apply to MaGIC program using [F7 form](../../by-modules/open-source-modules/f7-form/) service using their existing organisations profile thru the selection list.

1. Save Time of applicant reinserting same information over and over again
2. Prevent duplication of entries
3. Make data cleaning job easier as we are referring to the organisation using ID instead of name variants.
