### Create Organisations

You may create a new organisation profile if it does not exists in CENTRAL yet. Or, you may join an existing organisation profile.

### Update Organisation

{% hint style="info" %}
Don't be surprise if you are not able to update organisation thru Member Control Panel. Your access to modify may be removed by admin for various reasons:

* You are creating multiple duplicate profiles of the same company
* We had improved your organisation's detail and like it to be lock temporary, free from unexpected update.
{% endhint %}
