What you need is just a company/business registration number to be put in the `Company Number` field. You can use either new format number or old format number. **Do not put both** format number. The `Title` is an optional field. If the request is success, it will automatically update the `Title` based on the return result.

Basically this function will purchase the company/business profile through the API. Each success request will cost us about RM15.30 (including service tax).
