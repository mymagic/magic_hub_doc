What you need is just a company/business registration number to be put in `Entity Number` field. The `Title` is an optional field. If the request is success, it will automatically update the `Title` based on the return result.

Basically this function will purchase the company/business profile through the API. Each success request will cost us about RM15.30 \(including service tax\).
