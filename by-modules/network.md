# Network

Network is a module that to replace community. Inspired by [StartupSg](https://www.startupsg.gov.sg/) and [StartupBlink](https://startupblink.com/), it provides map  driven filter to browse and search alumni.

### Integrate with Resource Directory

Network service is integrated with [Resource Directory](resource-directory.md). For example, clicking a startup from 'Global Accelerator Program' will be able to link you to this specific resources under resource directory. From there, not only you can learn about the program but also access to list of startups benefited by it.

### Data Source

Our data came from these sources:

* Application form that startup submitted
* Organisation information that startup updated thru Member Control Panel
* Survey answered by the startup
* Our ecosystem partners
* Public information found on social media
* Public information on the internet \(crunchbase, data.gov.my, etc\)

While we try to make sure these information are as accurate as possible, by tied it up with our KPI creating a single source of truth, but it should only be use as a reference.

### For entire ecosystem use

In near future, we like the entire ecosystem \(e.g. MDeC, Cradle, SITEC, SMA, SCEIC...\) to use this same interface to list their alumni. Then, we will have a comprehensive ecosystem wide database that everyone can refer to.
