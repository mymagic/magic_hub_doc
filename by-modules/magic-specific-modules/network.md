### Integrate with Resource Directory

Network service is integrated with [Resource Directory](../open-source-modules/resource-directory.md). For example, clicking a startup from 'Global Accelerator Program' will be able to link you to this specific resources under resource directory. From there, not only you can learn about the program but also access to list of startups benefited by it.
