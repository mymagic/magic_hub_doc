1. Navigate to the [Perks ](https://central.mymagic.my/campus/perks)page under Campus ID service. You can see all the available perks that are offered here.
2. Click the `redeem` button on any of the perks to redeem. Note that you can only redeem perks if you meet the minimum experience \(XP\) requirement & has sufficient redeemable points \(RP\) required by each perk.
