# How to get listed

### Steps to get listed

1. **Create a Project Page**

   Fill up a form to build an all in one page for people to know about your organization, the project, and how they can reach out to you. When you are done click submit.

2. **Submit for Review**

   MaGIC will review your project page and maybe get in touch to jazz it up. When your application is looking amazing we publish it.

3. **Wait and Share**

   Stand by to receive emails from funders and experts getting in touch to help you. While you wait feel free to use your page as a project portfolio to share with others.
