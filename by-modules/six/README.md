### How SIX works

SIX is a project listing platform for Impact Driven Organisations \(IDOs\) to create a project page capturing the problem, solution and assistance they require. In turn, funders and experts can browse through to identify projects of interest - connecting directly with the IDO for possible funding or capacity building support through SIX.

#### **1.  Projects listed tell their story and support they need** 

An IDOâ€™s existence starts with tackling a social or environmental problem. They come up with solutions and at times we all need additional support, financially or non-financially. SIX is the place to tell your project story constructively, containing the necessary info and tags for funders and experts to find and connect with your project.

#### **2. Browse and identify projects to fund and help** 

Be it as an individual or organisation you can provide help through funding and skills you have to offer. Filter through projects verified by MaGIC and find something that speaks to you.

#### **3. Connect for collective impact and value exchange** 

Get in touch directly with the IDO of the project you are interested in to lend a hand. Drop them a message via SIX to connect and continue the conversation on any platform of your choice.
