### Getting Approval & Featured

It's solely MaGIC Program Owner or Admin's decision to approve, process, or reject a project.&#x20;

If the admin reviewed your project and anything needs to be replaced, the admin will change your project status to processing and update you on the fields that need to be changed/ added accordingly.

Only during processing status, you are allowed to edit your information.&#x20;

If you are to edit the application after approval, you need to contact the admin to request to edit, so they will change your status to processing to allow changes. This process will need to go through reviewing by the admin again.&#x20;
