#### Auto with SSM

{% hint style="info" %}
This is a planned feature which is not implemented yet.
{% endhint %}

#### Manual Process

Organisation EKYC verification process is all manual at the moment. Similar to 'EKYC for User' :

1. User to upload required scanned ID documents and input detail
2. Admin will process accordingly. Admin may raise question to user \(e.g. to upload a clearer document\) and the applicant will be notified thru email or he can check thru frontend interface at  `ekyc/frontend/manage`
