The following flowchart demonstrates the basic flow of the approval process.

#### Processing

The "Processing" step is used to notify the applicants to fix any problems with the submission. Once the problem is rectified by the applicant, the applicant can submit the job vacancy again for approval. The submission label will be reverted to "Submitted" from "Processing".

After clicking the "Processing" button, the admin can inform the applicant on any problems that requires fixing with a message.
