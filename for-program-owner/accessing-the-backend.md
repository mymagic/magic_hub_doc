or, you may access directly from URL: [https://central.mymagic.my/backend](https://central.mymagic.my/backend)

### Production vs Staging

Understand the concept between production and staging. Production is our live server where public users are using it all the time. Staging is our test server, where developers using it to double-check code is working in a server environment mimic the production. Of course, different environments connect to different database servers. 

Production Backend: [https://central.mymagic.my/backend](https://central.mymagic.my/backend)  
Staging Backend: [https://hub.mymagic.my/backend](https://hub.mymagic.my/backend)

Make sure you log in to the correct one.
