# Train the trainer

Programs like **MBEP** can make use of Central to track the performance of the trainer we trained thru the use of **Eventbrite**.

Eg. FounderClub from Sarawak is a trainer MaGIC trained. We like to know not only how many training sessions they provided in Miri but also who are these participants.

It can be achieved with FounderClub using their own Eventbrite account for their participant registration process: 

1. FounderClub setup an Eventbrite account and configure callback to Central API
2. Admin register FounderClub Eventbrite API Token into Central
