# Submitting Request to Tech team

To handle program owners request better in a more systematic way, we introduced '[Tech Software Request Form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/147kl-tehu3Z3rVUBiNRcJlyVuVGqYcPXulRXyEPkxQE/)'. Please feel free to duplicate this template and fill it up to submit to Tech through JIRA \(preferred\) or Email.

This is also part of our SOP process and requirements from '[SOP Event & Program Management'](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11iDCfN-OZ_CGii43_-A23t8tZQ5axcDI/view?usp=sharing) & '[SOP System Development](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i34sAP5hJLr5dIL5E__cXeXOI3qFK4bJ/view?usp=sharing)'. \(we are refining these SOP\)
