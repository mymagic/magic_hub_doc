# Running an accelerator

**ATAS \(Accelerator Tracking Application System\)**

Built as a separate and individual system, it is now integrated and become part of Central in module form starting **GAP05**. 

ATAS module makes use of various modules such as **F7 Form, milestone, claim & mentorship.** 

### Discontinue of ATAS individual system

We decided to discontinue ATAS individual system due to:

* Long turnaround time of about 2 weeks to create a new form \(programming in PHP required\)
* Eliminate the need to maintain multiple individual systems
