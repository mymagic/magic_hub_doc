# Running a program

### **F7 Form**

Programs with a selection stage like Bootcamps, University Startup Challenge \(**USC**\), MaGIC Ecosystem Builder Programs \(**MEBP**\), ACE MyStartupHub \(**MSH**\) & Global Market-Fit Program \(**GMP**\) and etc make use of **F7 Form** for the entire process.

{% hint style="info" %}
F7 is a Google form like CENTRAL module. Developers can create new form quickly in JSON language at a turnaround time of about 3 working days. 
{% endhint %}

Data from **F7 Form** will then sync to **Event** module in CENTRAL for centralized repository and reporting.

Accelerators such as Global Accelerator Program \(**GAP**\) are excluded.
