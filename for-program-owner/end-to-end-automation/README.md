{% endembed %}

### How it works

CENTRAL tracks all activities happening in the organization**. **Regardless if it's a one-off event like fireside chat, online/offline sharing session, workshop; or a series of events like **Grill-or-chill**, **USC**, various **bootcamps **and** accelerator p**rograms, and etc; they are all recorded into the system as an **event**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
KPI Dashboard and Survey only work when data is captured in CENTRAL event.
{% endhint %}

An event has the following basic attributes:

* Title
* Start & End Date
* Who are the individuals that participated (registration & attendance)
* Who are the organizations that participated (registration & attendance)
* Who are the organizer / owner / sponsor / partner
* Event for which industry, persona, SDG, etc.

#### Custom Build by Tech

* Use by SEA / NTIS / SIM type of large, long term and complicated type of programs.&#x20;
* Tech needs budget from PO to employ extra SLA Vendore to work on this.&#x20;

* Most are ad-hoc external programs given to MaGIC in rush deadline or with special requirement that the above method cannot support.&#x20;
