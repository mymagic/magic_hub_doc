**ATAS (Accelerator Tracking Application System)**

Historically built as a separate and standalone system, it is now integrated and has become a part of CENTRAL module starting from **GAP05**.&#x20;

ATAS module makes use of various other modules such as **F7 Form, Milestone, Claim & Mentorship.**&#x20;

### ATAS in CENTRAL

Todo

{% content-ref url="../../by-modules/atas/" %}
[atas](../../by-modules/atas/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Discontinue of ATAS standalone

We decided to discontinue ATAS standalone system due to:

* Long turnaround time of about 2 weeks to create a new form (programming in PHP required)
* Eliminate the need to maintain multiple individual systems
