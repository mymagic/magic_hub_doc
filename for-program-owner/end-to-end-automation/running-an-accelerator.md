**ATAS \(Accelerator Tracking Application System\)**

Historically built as a separate and standalone system, it is now integrated and has become a part of CENTRAL module starting from **GAP05**. 

ATAS module makes use of various other modules such as **F7 Form, Milestone, Claim & Mentorship.** 

### ATAS in CENTRAL

Todo

### Discontinue of ATAS standalone

We decided to discontinue ATAS standalone system due to:

* Long turnaround time of about 2 weeks to create a new form \(programming in PHP required\)
* Eliminate the need to maintain multiple individual systems
