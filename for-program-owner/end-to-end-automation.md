# End-to-end Automation

MaGIC Central facilitates your programs and events from the application stage, selection stage, and up to KPI reporting stage. The main goal is to reduce human intervention in the process to ensure data integrity and to promote transparency.

### How it works

Central tracks all activities happening in the organization**.** Regardless it's an one-off event like fireside chat, online/offline sharing session, workshop or series of events like **Grill-or-chill**, **USC**, various **bootcamps** and **accelerator p**rograms, and etc; they are all recorded into the system as an **event**.

An event has the following basic attributes:

* Title
* Start & End Date
* Who are the individuals that participated \(registration & attendance\)
* Who are the organizations that participated \(registration & attendance\)
* Who are the organizer / owner / sponsor / partner
* Event for which industry, persona, SDG, etc.
