# End-to-end Automation

CENTRAL facilitates your programs and events from the application stage, selection stage, post-event survey and up to KPI reporting stage. The main goal is to reduce human intervention in the process to ensure data integrity and to promote transparency.

### How it works

CENTRAL tracks all activities happening in the organization**.** Regardless it's an one-off event like fireside chat, online/offline sharing session, workshop; or series of events like **Grill-or-chill**, **USC**, various **bootcamps** and **accelerator p**rograms, and etc; they are all recorded into the system as an **event**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
KPI Dashboard and Survey only works when data is captured in CENTRAL event.
{% endhint %}

An event has the following basic attributes:

* Title
* Start & End Date
* Who are the individuals that participated \(registration & attendance\)
* Who are the organizations that participated \(registration & attendance\)
* Who are the organizer / owner / sponsor / partner
* Event for which industry, persona, SDG, etc.

#### ATAS

{% page-ref page="running-an-accelerator.md" %}

#### Custom Build by Tech

* Tech needs budget from PO to employ extra SLA Vendore to work on this. 
* Data can be auto/manually sync base on programming set by Tech team.

**Third Party Vendor**

* Most are ad-hoc external programs given to MaGIC in rush deadline or with special requirement the above method cannot support.
