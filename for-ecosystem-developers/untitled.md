# OpenHub

OpenHub is an **open source** version of MaGIC Central, available for **FREE** for all MaGIC-like ecosystem developers at different geo location. 

We hope thru this open source initiative, MaGIC-like ecosystem developers can come together and build a shared digital platform where everybody can be benefited from it.
